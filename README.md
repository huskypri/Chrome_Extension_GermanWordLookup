# Chrome_Extension_GermanWordLookup
GermanWordLookup is a Chrome extension that helps you quickly translate German words into English using dict.cc . Simply select a German word in any website, press Ctrl + any key, and a translation window will pop up with the result. You can close the window anytime and continue browsing without interruptions.

Set Up procedure is described below --> 
1. Downlaod or, clone the files and save them in a folder of your local computer
1. Go to Chrome Browser 'Settings' and then 'Extensions'
2. Activate the developer mode
3. Click 'Load unpacked' and select the same folder, where all files are located
4. Go to 'Keyboard shortcuts' and Edit or, provide the Action to execute the chrome extension. E.g. ctrl + Q or whatever you like
5. Restart your browser and That's it

So next time, you are reading a German website and if you don't know a word, then select the word using mouse and then execute your provided Action (hit e.g. ctrl +Q) and it will open a Pop Window with German translation from dict.cc website. There is an option to close it, so that you can continue browsing without any interuption. Give it a shot. Enjoy :)

This chorme extension is useful for those, who knows little bit of German and really lazy people (:P) and they don't need the full sentence translation, only the strange German Wword! I hope you like the idea.
